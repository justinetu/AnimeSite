        <em>This by far is my favorite anime as it is like no other anime I have ever seen before. We get to see the characters grow from<br> when they are in highschool till they are grown adults not only that but this anime takes viewers on an emotional roller coaster<br> with its many tragic scenes leaving viewers happy, sad, and scared at times. All in all, I give this anime a 10 out of 10.</em><br>

        <em>This anime I thought was rather unique the whole idea of being mentally trapped in a virtual reality game against your will and the only possible way of escaping being to defeat the game. This anime for me was emotional at times but I enjoyed it's action packed scenes. Overall, I give this one a 7 out of 10</em>
